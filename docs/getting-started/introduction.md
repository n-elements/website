# Introduction

Native Elements (NE) is not a CSS framework, no bundlers required or tons of configurations to set. You can consider it as a customizable plug-n-play library for your site which helps you easily style all the available HTML elements using CSS custom properties, classes, attributes, or whatever you want in less than `6 kB`. You can also build your class-based CSS framework on top of it.

```css
/* Plugin: Zoom Image
============================================================================= */
:root {
  --zoomimage-overlay-background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.875);
}
```
