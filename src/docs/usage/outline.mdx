Native Elements adds by default the outline indicator to any focusable elements when they are on `:focus` state.

Since the outline indicator is useful for the keyboard and AT navigation, you should never completely hide it. We strongly suggest to hide the outline when appropriate, for example using [`what-input`](https://github.com/ten1seven/what-input) you can do this by including it in your JavaScript file, then add this CSS snippet:

```css

[data-whatintent='mouse'] *:focus {
  outline: none;
}
```

By this way, thanks to what-input which will add `[data-whatintent='mouse']` to the `html` element, the outline indicator will be visible only when users will use the keyboard as input to navigate through the page.
